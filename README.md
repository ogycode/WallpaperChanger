## Wallpaper Changer 2
**The application for installing HD wallpapers on your desktop.
In the application, you can configure the replacement of wallpaper on a schedule. Select one of several image sources. Liked wallpaper can be added to favorites, so that you can then install them again.
In Walpaper Chnager 2 there is a parametric search for images by color, by tag (available in one of the wallpaper sources). The application runs in the background and does not take a lot of resources.**
